# TybeeIsland - Vacation Site 
Hello and welcome. This was my first big project that I created. I wanted my MIL to have an pretty good website for her b'day trip. This is it. 

Since this is a practice / demo project the photos are just from the web and not vetted for copywrite status. 

This project showcases:
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
BootStrap
JQuery 
FontAwesome
Google Fonts

Enjoy!
